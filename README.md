# homework-preamble

A simple template for psets designed mainly for problems out of texts, but also novel, prof-specific problems.
I like to TeX each problem on top of my solutions as a study tool, so that you don't have to go back and find each problem in the book or online.
For these purposes, I'd highly recommend mathpix.com, mathstackexchange, and DeTeXify.
Feel free to copy and paste!
